	<h5 align=center>Growing the beans</h5>
		<img src="images/coffeePlant.png" style="float:right;width:250px;padding:30px;border-radius:15px;">

	World-wide, there are over 40 million trees producing some 24 kilotons of beans every day.
	To grow coffee, farmers can use devices to monitor soil, sunlight, and water.
	The <a href="03-TransactionsM2M.htm">coffee farm water conservation lab</a> in this course demonstrates a device with 
	 sensors to monitor plants that uses IOTA tokens to buy water when the plants are thirsty.  
	This type of transaction is an example of a M2M or "machine-to-machine" transaction.
	<br><br>	
	Periodically, coffee inspectors travel to the farm where they can record the type of seed, fertilizer, farm location, coffee family, and inspection results in 
	data transactions.

	<h5 align=center>Picking, drying, & bagging</h5>
	Every day about 400 bags of coffee (each weighing about 130 lbs) are processed.
	Harvesters can record dates and results of plucking, hulling, polishing, grading, and sorting on the quality certificate.
	This is an example of a data transaction with a document attachment.
	<br><br><br>

	<h5 align=center>Loading & shipping & unloading</h5>
	Coffee bags are loaded and unloaded from over 1600 shipping containers.
	Shippers, forwarders, and port workers can track shipments using messages (another type of transaction) and M2M transactions.  
	Customs officials can record inspections using data transactions with attachments.
	<br><br>

	<h5 align=center>Roasting & Re-packaging</h5>
	Coffee beans are roasted and re-packaged into over 48 million 1-lb bags.  Roasters can record data using messages and data transactions with attachments.
	<br><br>

	<h5 align=center>Selling</h5>
	More than 2 trillion cups of coffee are sold each day.
	In some cities, you can purchase a cup of coffee using IOTA tokens.  That is an example of a value transaction.
	You can also use a QR code to check out all the transactions along your coffee bean's journey.

	<br><br>
	<h5 align=center>IOTA Transactions</h5>
	In this micro-course, you will learn how to send and receive these transactions:
	<ul>
	<li>Data Transaction</li>
	<li>Data Transaction with attachment</li>
	<li>M2M Transaction using IOTA tokens</li>
	<li>Messages</li>
	<li>Value Transaction</li>
	</ul>
